\section{New Analysis}\label{sec:newAnalysis}
%0.8 scc views
We now present the new analysis method applied to the original data.
We measure $SPL_s$, the average
shortest path length in the LSCC of the network where the size of
the LSCC is at least 80\% of the original number of individuals.

In figure \ref{fig:base-reduced} there is no obvious decrease in $SPL_s$,
contradicting the results in the original paper.
We do however confirm that $<CD>$ is maintained as $\sd$ and $\ss$ increases.


\subsection{New Analysis: Linear Regression}

\begin{gather}
    <CD> ~ \thicksim ~ 2.28 + 1.73\sd + 1.82\ss - 2.20\sw -
                5.44\ds + 2.92\dw + 3.05\ssw \label{red1}\\
    <SPL_s> ~ \thicksim ~ 2.40 + 0.27\sd + 0.22\ss - 0.10 \sw -
                0.14\ds + 0.17\dw + 0.17\ssw \label{red2}
\end{gather}

In terms of $<CD>$ equation (\ref{red1}) is very close to equation (\ref{one}).
However, as foreshadowed, $<SPL_s>$ shows a very different behavior.
In equation (\ref{red2}), $<SPL_s>$ actually increases with $\sd$, which is
directly opposite to the relationship observed in the original results.
Again, this points to the weakness in $<SPL>$ as originally defined.
All terms were extremely significant as per the ANOVA analysis.
